              <p>
                Avalanches are mass-wasting events where unstable snow suddenly begins sliding down a slope.
                Avalanches are often triggered by some kind of disturbance and can be very dangerous to skiers, snowboarders, and mountaineers,
                particularly in the backcountry. This website means to spread awareness about the dangers and provide an 
                understanding of the complicated mechanics of avalanches and snowpack

            <h3>Sluff vs Slab</h3>
            <h1>Types of Avalanches</h1>
            &nbsp;
            <h4>Loose Snow Avalanches</h4>
            <p>
              These avalanches occur when the snow is loose and not stuck together. They start at a single point and spread outwards 
              in a fan shape down the slope. These types of avalanches are also known as <span>Point Release Avalanches</span> and 
              are generally less dangerous than their slab counterparts
            </p>
            <h5>Dry Loose</h5>
            <p>
              Commonly referred to as <span>Sluff</span> by skiers and snowboarders, dry loose avalanches are usually not a serious hazard,
              however, they can knock skiers and snowboarders off balance or drag them into unsafe situations
            </p>
            <h5>Wet Loose</h5>
            <p>
              Similar to dry loose, wet loose avalanches occur when heavy wet top snow slides down the slope. These are most common in the spring 
              and later in the day when warmer temperatures begin melting creating heavy and wet snow
            </p>
            &nbsp;
            <h4>Slab Avalanches</h4>
            <p>
              They occur when the upper layers of snow become stuck together to form a cohesive <span>Slab</span> which then releases and 
              slides down the slope. When the avalanche is triggered, the snow releases all at once and remains in big chunks. 
              These are the most dangerous type of avalanche as they result in a very large amount of snow moving extremely quickly. They can reach speeds of up to 120km/h and can be triggered in many different ways. Slopes between 35 and 45 degrees 
              are the most likely to experience extreme slab avalanches. These slopes are also the most ideal for 
              skiing and snowboarding which is why slab avalanches are so dangerous to snow sports
            </p>
            <h5>Types of Slab Avalanches:</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Wind Slab</li>
              <li>Storm Slab</li>

    <div class="text-center">
      <h3>Snow Characteristics</h3>
      <h1>Importance of Snowpack</h1>
      <p>
        Snowpack is the accumulation of <span>Snow Layers</span> that build up on the ground during the winter season. It plays a critical role in 
        avalanche dynamics, especially slab avalanches, as its stability is directly correlated with the avalanche risk. This stability 
        depends on the weather conditions, terrain features, and most of all the layers within the snowpack 
      </p>
      <h5>Snow Layer Strength</h5>
      <p>
        <span>Strong Layers</span> in the snowpack refers to snow layers made of snow that sticks to itself. The shape of the snow crystals in
        strong layers tends to be more <span>rounded</span> rather than the crystals found in <span>Weak Layers</span> which are more <span>faceted</span>,
        which means the snow does not stick to itself
      </p>
      <h5>Snowpack in Slab Avalanches</h5>
      <p>
        Slab Avalanches occur when there is a <span>weak layer</span> of snow between two strong layers. The strong layer of snow on top is called 
        the <span>Overlying Slab</span> and the strong layer at the bottom is called the <span>Bed Surface</span>. When the slab avalanche occurs, the weak layer 
        of snow that doesn't stick to itself isn't strong enough to hold the overlying slab resulting in the overlying slab breaking away and sliding down the slope
      </p>
      &nbsp;
      <h2>How Do Weak Layers Form?</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="row ">
      <div class="col-md-4 mt-4">
        <div class="content"> 
            <div class="content-overlay"></div> 
            <p>
              On cold clear nights, the surface snow cools down enough to attract moisture from the air around it which then freezes. This forms
              a layer of frost on the surface of the snow called <span>Surface Hoar</span> that does not stick to itself. Usually, this is quickly broken down 
              by sun or wind, however, If there is snowfall directly after these crystals form then the surface hoar gets trapped in the snowpack which can form a very
              unstable and weak layer below the new snow
            </p>
            <div class="content-details fadeIn-bottom">
              <h3 class="content-title">Surface Hoar</h3>

        <div class="content"> 
            <div class="content-overlay"></div> 
            <p>
              When there is a strong <span>Temperature Gradient</span> in the snowpack, facets can develop from the inside leading to weak layers. This gradient must be 
              >1 degree per 10cm for these facets to form. The warmer snow at the bottom of the snowpack will turn directly from solid crystals to water vapor. This vapor 
              then rises up through the snowpack eventually re-freezing due to the colder temperatures high in the snowpack leading to weak faceted crystals
            </p>
            <div class="content-details fadeIn-bottom">
              <h3 class="content-title">Temperature Gradient</h3>
                <p class="content-text"><i class="fa fa-thermometer-empty fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i></i></p>

            <p>
              Although rain and warm temperature are uncommon during the winter season, they do still occur and can cause very unstable weak layers within a snowpack.
              When the upper layer of snow melts or rain occurs followed by cold temperatures, this extra moisture freezes and a <span>Melt-freeze Crust</span> forms 
              on the surface of the snow. This is a layer of ice that bonds very poorly with the layers of snow that accumulated on top of it

        <h1>Testing The Snowpack</h1>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
          Testing the snowpack is essential for avalanche risk assessment. Multiple tests are conducted to check for any weak layers or instability. To perform these 
          tests, a pit is dug that shows the cross-section of the snowpack. At this point, the temperatures at the bottom and top of the snowpack are 
          measured to check the thermal gradient
        </p>
        <h4>Snowpack Tests</h4>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span>Compression Test</span> - Pressure is applied to the top of an isolated column of the snowpack until it collapses. This is done to 
              determine stability and any weak layers present
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
              <span>Extended Column Test</span> - Similar to the compression test but done with a larger section of te snowpack to get better insight into 
              the stability across a wider area
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
              <span>Rutschblock Test</span> - Checks how easily a block of snow can be released to determine how prone to sliding the layer is 
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
              <span>Shear Test</span> - Similar to the pressure test but focuses more on specific layers to check how easily they shear off

      <h3>Safety Training and Gear</h3>
      <h1>Avalanche Safety Training 1 (AST1)</h1>
      <p>
        Avalanche training courses, more specifically Avalanche Skills Training Level 1 (AST1) and Level 2 (AST2), give essential 
 knowledge and experience for anyone looking to explore the backcountry or avalanche-prone terrain. The focus of these courses 
 is safety, decision-making, and situational awareness. On top of being essential for backcountry, some resorts such 
 as <span>Sunshine Ski Resort</span> in Banff have in-bounds terrain that requires AST1 certification and avalanche gear to access
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of training, avalanche gear is essential for safety in the backcountry. The key pieces of gear are a <span>Transiver</span> which
        is used to locate someone buried in snow, a <span>Probe</span> which is used to pinpoint the exact location of the buried person, and a <span>Shovel</span>
        to dig. Additionally, <span>Airbags</span> can keep you on the surface of the snow in the event of an avalanche and <span>First Aid Kits</span> are also 
        valuable for increasing safety in the backcountry
